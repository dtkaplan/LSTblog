There are many innovations in LST. This blog has posts to orient new instructors both to the topics in LST and the software provided by the {LSTbook} R package."

    "section": "",
    "text": "After more than a year of development, the {LSTbook} R package has been released to CRAN, the official distribution site for R packages. You can browse through the package vignettes and documentation at package repository, and install {LSTbook} in the normal way:\ninstall.packages(\"LSTbook\")\nThe LST book contains many examples using data. Many of the data frames referenced in LST are provided by {LSTbook}. (Others are provided by mosaicData and other similar packages.)\nPerhaps more importantly, LST uses a very streamlined syntax for commands unified around the R pipe (|&gt;) and is designed to interoperate with tidy packages such as {dplyr}. Almost every R command used in LST has a consistent structure:\nThe noun is typically a data frame. The verbs are graphics and wrangling operations, model fitting, model summarizing, simulating with DAGs. {LSTbook} provides a handful of easy-to-use verbs that permit sophisticated computing with a simple syntax.\nAfter you’ve installed {LSTbook}, load it into your R session:\nlibrary(LSTbook)\nWe’ll illustrate the most commonly used R functions from {LSTbook} using the mosaicData::Galton data frame. This contains Francis Galton’s data from 1880s London on the height of fully-grown children and their parents."

    "section": "Graphics",
    "text": "Graphics\nLST uses a single, standard graphics type: the annotated point plot. The virtue of standardizing graphics is that students know what they are looking at. For example, the axes are always variables and the layout of the point plot is described by a tilde-expression such as height ~ mother. Try out these examples:\n\nmosaicData::Galton |&gt; point_plot(height ~ sex)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmosaicData::Galton |&gt; point_plot(height ~ mother)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmosaicData::Galton |&gt; point_plot(height ~ mother + sex)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGraphics with four variables are difficult for newbies to interpret, but they are easy to make with point_plot():\n\nmosaicData::Galton |&gt;\n  point_plot(height ~ mother + father + sex, annot = \"model\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe annot = \"model\" argument instructs point_plot() to annotate the point plot with the model function corresponding to the tilde expression. I think the model is the only way to make sense of the 4-variable point plot, but annot = \"model\" applies to simpler plots as well."

This can be introduced gently with the point_plot(..., annot = \"model\") graphic, but it applies as well to more formal methods such as confidence intervals and prediction intervals.
