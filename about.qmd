The beta version of [*Lessons in Statistical Thinking* (LST)](dtkaplan.github.io/Lessons-in-statistical-thinking) was released in February 2024.

LST is intended as a first statistics course but many of the topics are suitable for a second-statistics course as well. There are many innovations in LST. This blog has posts to orient new instructors both to the topics in LST and the software provided by the `{LSTbook}` R package.
