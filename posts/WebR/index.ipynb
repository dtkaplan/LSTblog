        "- Documents including computation are ordinary HTML (+  JavaScript) that can be posted on the web in straightforward ways.\n",

        "We will use the [*quarto*](https://quarto.org/) system for producing HTML documents. Consequently, a first step is to install *quarto* on your computer. You need version 1.4 (or later), so even if you have already been using *quarto*, you may need to update. [To find out, give this command in your **terminal**: `quarto --version`]{.aside} Follow the \"Get Started\" link on the [*quarto*](https://quarto.org/) homepage.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Quarto* is a stand-alone program. You will be using it from RStudio, but there are a couple of occasions when you will use the **terminal* rather than the R console to set things up.\n",
        "\n",
        "We presume that you have R and RStudio installed. If you are not familiar with RStudio, you will need to become so before you can make sense of the following instructions.\n",
        "\n",
        "At this point, we won't worry about how to deploy the documents you write on a web site. You can write functioning documents without this. That way you can try out WebR before having to set up a web site. (See web documentation on \"quarto blog site\" (e.g. [this page](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/)) if you're curious about how to set up a suitable web site.)\n",

        "## Producing your first document\n",
        "\n",
        "There's an excellent [four-minute video](https://youtu.be/DoRR2S5lLvk?t=5) by James Balamuta, the *Coatless Professor*. This covers just about everything you need to get started (once you have installed *quarto* and RStudio), including creating an RStudio project and a *quarto* document.\n",
        "\n",
        "Take care to note what is clearly shown at time 1:38 in the video, the very brief use of the **terminal** (as opposed to the R console) to give the command up the RStudio project to use WebR. \n",

        "\n",
        "The *Coatless Professor*'s video brings you all the way through displaying a working WebR document in the RStudio \"Viewer\" tab. But you can equally well open the document in a browser. (On the Viewer tab menu bar, click the \"Show in New Window\" button, which looks like a sheet of paper with an upward-facing arrow.)\n",
        "\n",
        "The *Coatless Professor* provides more links to information [on this GitHub web page](https://github.com/coatless/quarto-webr?tab=readme-ov-file).

You may want to exclude some of these or include others (such as the `{mosaic}` package.) For those packages listed, you will not have to use the `library()` command in your WebR document. Neither do you need to `install.packages()`, this happens automatically. (Note that you can use `library()` in a WebR chunk, if that suits your pedagogy.)\n"
