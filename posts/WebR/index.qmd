This page provides an easy way to get started with computing for *Lessons in Statistical Thinking*.

Instructions: 

1. Give your commands in the code blocks below.
2. If something in Code Block 2 depends on an object created (with `<-`) in Code Block 1, run Code Block 1 first.
3. Keeping this page open in your browser will help speed the initialization.

**Code Block 1**
```{webr-r}
Mod1 <- mtcars |> model_train(mpg ~ hp + wt)


```

**Code Block 2**
```{webr-r}
Mod1 |> conf_interval()


```

## The storage arrow

Press the "start over" icon (<i class="fa-solid fa-rotate"></i>) in Code Blocks 1 and 2 to reset the blocks to their original content. 

*Background*

i. Note in Code Block 1 that the storage arrow (`<-`) is being used to create an object called `Mod1`.
ii. Note also that Code Block 2 puts the `Mod1` object at the start of a pipeline.

*Activity*

a. Run Code Block 2 *without* having previously run Block 1. What happens?
b. Now run Block 1. Afterwards, run Block 2. What has changed from (a)?
c. Press <i class="fa-solid fa-rotate"></i> in Block 1. then run Block 2 again. What happens?
d. Run Block 1 again, then press <i class="fa-solid fa-rotate"></i> for Block 2. Can you then run Block 2 successfully?

## Basics of computing in *Lessons*

### Data frames

Many data frames are already available by name. Commonly used examples in *Lessons* include: `Birdkeepers`, `Grades`, `Galton`, `Hill_racing`, `Penguins`, `SAT`, `TenMileRace`, `Whickham`

**Looking at the codebook for a data frame**

Use `??` followed by the name of the data frame.
```{webr-r}
??Birdkeepers
```

**See the first several rows**

```{webr-r}
Birdkeepers |> head()
```

**See the variable names**

```{webr-r}
Birdkeepers |> names()
```

### Annotated point plots

```{webr-r}
Birdkeepers |> 
  point_plot(YR ~ AG + FM, annot = "model")
```
